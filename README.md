#CartoPress
###A CartoDB Client for WordPress

CartoPress is a plugin that links CartoDB, an open-source and API-driven webmapping platform, to the world's most popular CMS: WordPress.

CartoPress was built to provide the ability to turn your WordPress-based site into a geo-CMS using the CartoDB platform, allowing you to design interesting interactive maps and geo-spatial appliations from your existing WordPress data. Here we have created a bridge, a means to traverse the infinite possibilites of mapping styles and visualizations with the ease of Wordpress. Users can now link directly to the CartoDB-hosted account and immediately link their posts/stories, with georeferencing data.

####KEY FEATURES
* Use CartoDB's intuitive user-interface to quickly and easily make maps and spatialize your WordPress data
* Georeferece your posts, pages and media attachments using the built-in CartoPress geocoder
* Configure settings to sync Post Content, Featured Image, Taxonomies, Author, and Custom Fields to your CartoDB dataset
* Ability to manually input and edit geodata
* Streamlined processes will automatically insert new data to your existing maps
* Use existing tables from your CartoDB account
* Add a custom summary description to your post to display in your map's infowindow
* Enhance your map by adding additional layers
* Make use of CartoDB's extensive styling wizards and CartoCSS to create beautiful maps with your data
* Easily publish maps on your site using CartoDB's iframe embedding or build a custom geo-spatial application from your WordPress data using the cartodb.js API
* Use CartoDB to export your data into various geo datatypes including SHP, KML, GeoJSON, CSV and SVG

####INSTALLATION

As simple as any other Wordpress plugin. Simply upload the zip file or add the folder to wp-contents/plugins in your wordpress distribution and ACTIVATE!

CartoDB requires an initial account. Our plugin provides instructions to quickly establish an account through CartoDB.com; From there, our wordpress plugin with automatically generate all required tables and field sets - linking the two platforms with ease.

HOW DOES CARTOPRESS HELP ME?

CartoDB is an extremely powerful platform, but understanding datasets, shapefiles, and GeoJSON data can be overwhelming and time-consuming for many users. CartoPress simplifies this process by linking these datasets and making them as simple as adding a new blog post. Each post, page, or even custom wordpress instance can have it's own linked CartoDB dataset.

With the tables already synced from Wordpress, all you have to do is make your CartoDB map visualization as pretty as your little heart desires using their powerful CartoCSS platform enhanced with various APIs.

Future releases of CartoPress also hope to bring these visualizations to life in various fashions on your own Wordpress site! Without the need for embedding iFrames or exporting data from CartoDB!
