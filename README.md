#CartoPress
###A CartoDB Client for WordPress

CartoDB is an open source tool that allows for the storage and visualization of geospatial data on the web.

CartoPress is an open source plugin that links CartoDB to the world's most popular Content Management System: Wordpress.


Cartopress was built to provide unique, flexible and intuitive ways to create maps and design geospatial applications. The visualizations and capabilities fostered by CartoDB are limited only by one's imagination, but currently have been trapped in the confines of data sets and table values.

Here we have created a bridge, a means to traverse the infiniette possibilites of mapping styles and visualizations with the ease of Wordpress. Users can now link directly to the CartoDB-hosted account and immediately link their posts/stories, with georeferencing data. 

Instead of just searching Wordpress with keywords and tags, we've now introduced a fantastic way to search by location. Websites can now be enhanced with state-of-the-art mapping views and navigation of these sites can be redefined to imitate the dimensions of the world we live in.

INSTALLATION

As simple as any other Wordpress plugin. Simply upload the zip file or add the folder to wp-contents/plugins in your wordpress distribution and ACTIVATE!

CartoDB requires an initial account. Our plugin provides instructions to quickly establish an account through CartoDB.com; From there, our wordpress plugin with automatically generate all required tables and field sets - linking the two platforms with ease.

HOW DOES CARTOPRESS HELP ME?

CartoDB is an extremely powerful platform, but understanding datasets, shapefiles, and GeoJSON data can be overwhelming and time-consuming for many users. CartoPress simplifies this process by linking these datasets and making them as simple as adding a new blog post. Each post, page, or even custom wordpress instance can have it's own linked CartoDB dataset.

With the tables already synced from Wordpress, all you have to do is make your CartoDB map visualization as pretty as your little heart desires using their powerful CartoCSS platform enhanced with various APIs.

Future releases of CartoPress also hope to bring these visualizations to life in various fashions on your own Wordpress site! Without the need for embedding iFrames or exporting data from CartoDB!
